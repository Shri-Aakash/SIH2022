The problem statement in which we took part is AI based solution for elderly care.
For this problem statement we had an idea of making a Robot that could assist the elderly people with their day-to-day activities such as walking, taking their medicine, making sure they don't forget something etc..

This was done as old age people generally need someone to talk to so that they can have a sense of human conversation and this was our idea for the solution of AI Based solution for eldery care.
